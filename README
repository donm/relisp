= Relisp

== Synopsis

Emacs is great.  So is Ruby.  This purpose of this library is to:
* call Ruby from Emacs
* call Elisp from Ruby
* manipulate Emacs without using Elisp to some extent (Ruby wrappers
  around some Elisp functions and objects)
* reduce the number of blog entries titled "Is Ruby an acceptable
  lisp?" and flame wars under the title "ruby vs. lisp vs. scheme
  vs. haskell vs. ..."

== Install

   [sudo] gem install sundae

Then put <tt>src/relisp.el</tt> and/or <tt>src/relisp.elc</tt> in your
elisp directory (probably <tt>~/.elisp</tt>) and add <tt>(require
'relisp)</tt> to your emacs customization file (probably
<tt>~/.emacs</tt>).

== Usage

See the stuff in the +examples+ directory to get started.


== To Do

* finish implementing emacs editting types (Buffers, Frames, etc.)
* adapt for windows?
