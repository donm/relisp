# Emacs is great.  So is Ruby.  This is a collection of tools to
#   * call Ruby from Emacs (from elisp)
#   * call elisp from Ruby (once Ruby has been invoked from elisp)
#   * manipulate Emacs without using elisp (Ruby wrappers around some elisp operations)
#   * contribute to flame wars and blog entries titled "Ruby vs. lisp vs. scheme vs. haskell vs. ..."
